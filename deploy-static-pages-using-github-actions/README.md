# **How to Dynamically Generate and Deploy Static Pages Using GitHub Actions**

## **Prerequisites** 

- A GitHub account 
- A repository with your static site content (e.g., HTML, CSS) 
- Basic familiarity with YAML syntax 
- Access to GitHub Actions in your repository 

## **Step 1: Setting Up Your Repository** 

Ensure your repository contains all the static files necessary for your site. For example, HTML templates, CSS files, JavaScript, and any static assets like images or fonts. 

## **Step 2: Creating the GitHub Action Workflow**

1. In your repository, create a directory named '.github/workflows' if it doesn't already exist. 
2. Inside this directory, create a YAML file for your workflow, e.g., 'deploy_site.yml'. 

## **Step 3: Define the Workflow** 

Hereâ€™s a simple workflow definition that generates your static pages using a script and then deploys them: 

```yaml 
name: Generate and Deploy Site 
 
on: 
  push: 
    branches: 
      - main 
  schedule: 
    - cron: '0 0 * * *'  # Runs every day at midnight 
 
jobs: 
  build_and_deploy: 
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest 
 
    steps: 
    - name: Checkout code 
      uses: actions/checkout@v2 
 
    - name: Set up Python 
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2 
      with: 
        python-version: '3.x' 
 
    - name: Install dependencies 
      run: | 
        pip install -r requirements.txt 
 
    - name: Generate Static Pages 
      run: python generate_pages.py 
 
    - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages 
      uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3 
      with: 
        github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} 
        publish_dir: ./path_to_your_output_folder 
``` 

## **Step 4: Customize Your Actions** 

- Modify the 'cron' schedule to fit the frequency you need for updates. 
- Replace 'python generate_pages.py' with the actual command you use to generate your static pages. 
- Adjust 'path_to_your_output_folder' to the directory where your generated static files are stored. 

## **Step 5: Commit and Push** 

Commit your changes and push them to the main branch. GitHub Actions will automatically pick up this new workflow and run it according to the triggers set (on push to 'main' or on schedule). 

## **Step 6: Verify Your Workflow** 

Check the 'Actions' tab in your GitHub repository to see the execution of your workflow. If there are any issues, you can view the logs for each step to troubleshoot. 

## **Conclusion** 

By leveraging GitHub Actions, you can automate the generation and deployment of static pages, making your development process more efficient and your projects more dynamic. This setup not only reduces manual errors but also ensures that your content is always up-to-date with the latest changes in your repository.
